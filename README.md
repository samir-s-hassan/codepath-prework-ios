An app I would like to build is an app that tracks your expenses. With the countless expense tracking apps available, there is too many choices that  don't quite fit my own needs. For example, an expense tracking app such as Mint has payment plan options available that will make itself more usable and have core features. There are also mutliple expense tracking apps that ask for your bank account information and a lot of your user data. The expense tracking app I want to build is very barebones and to the point. You can simply enter your expenses as well as your revenues and put them into categories. I'll add multiple calendars such as daily, weekly, and monthly so the users can see their spending habits. I want this app to be catered towards as many people as possible so I won't many niche features or ask for weird permissions.

## Notes

    There were multiple challenges I encountered while building this app. For one, I couldn't find certain elements in the tutorial. I couldn't find the Attributes Inspector at first but I found it in the toolbar. Then, I couldn't find the Adjust Editor Options file. Once I was able to find these things, the Assistant within the drop-down menu wasn't showing anything. After I restarted the app, the Assistant started working and it showed "Finding dependencies." I realized that whenever this issue happened where the Assistant had nothing to show, I should simply just restart the app. My last challenge I had was that I didn't set it as a IBAction. I was confused and this didn't let me add the randomColor function.
